    def manage_existing_snapshot(self, snapshot, existing_ref):
        """Brings an existing backend storage object under Cinder management.

        existing_ref is passed straight through from the API request's
        manage_existing_ref value, and it is up to the driver how this should
        be interpreted.  It should be sufficient to identify a storage object
        that the driver should somehow associate with the newly-created cinder
        snapshot structure.

        There are two ways to do this:

        1. Rename the backend storage object so that it matches the
           snapshot['name'] which is how drivers traditionally map between a
           cinder snapshot and the associated backend storage object.

        2. Place some metadata on the snapshot, or somewhere in the backend,
           that allows other driver requests (e.g. delete) to locate the
           backend storage object when required.

        :param snapshot: The snapshot to manage.
        :param existing_ref: Dictionary with keys 'source-id', 'source-name'
                             with driver-specific values to identify a backend
                             storage object.
        :raises: ManageExistingInvalidReference If the existing_ref doesn't
                 make sense, or doesn't refer to an existing backend storage
                 object.

        """Return size of snapshot to be managed by manage_existing.

        When calculating the size, round up to the next GB.

        :param snapshot: The snapshot to manage.
        :param existing_ref: Dictionary with keys 'source-id', 'source-name'

    def unmanage_snapshot(self, snapshot):
        """Removes the specified snapshot from Cinder management.

        Does not delete the underlying backend storage object.

        For most drivers, this will not need to do anything. However, some
        drivers might use this call as an opportunity to clean up any
        Cinder-specific configuration that they have associated with the
        backend storage object.
