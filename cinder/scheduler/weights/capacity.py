"""
Weighers that weigh hosts by their capacity, including following two
weighers:

1. Capacity Weigher.  Weigh hosts by their virtual or actual free capacity.

For thin provisioning, weigh hosts by their virtual free capacity calculated
by the total capacity multiplied by the max over subscription ratio and
subtracting the provisioned capacity; Otherwise, weigh hosts by their actual
free capacity, taking into account the reserved space.

The default is to spread volumes across all hosts evenly.  If you prefer
stacking, you can set the 'capacity_weight_multiplier' option to a negative
number and the weighing has the opposite effect of the default.

2. Allocated Capacity Weigher.  Weigh hosts by their allocated capacity.

The default behavior is to place new volume to the host allocated the least
space.  This weigher is intended to simulate the behavior of SimpleScheduler.
If you prefer to place volumes to host allocated the most space, you can
set the 'allocated_capacity_weight_multiplier' option to a positive number
and the weighing has the opposite effect of the default.
