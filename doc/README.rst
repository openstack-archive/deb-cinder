Cinder Development Docs
=======================

Files under this directory tree are used for generating the documentation
for the Cinder source code.

http://docs.openstack.org/developer/cinder/

Tools
=====

Sphinx
  The Python Sphinx package is used to generate the documentation output.
  Information on Sphinx, including formatting information for RST source
  files, can be found in the `Sphinx online documentation 
  <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/>`_.

Graphviz
  Some of the diagrams are generated using the ``dot`` language
  from Graphviz. See the `Graphviz documentation <http://www.graphviz.org/>`_
  for Graphviz and dot language usage information.
