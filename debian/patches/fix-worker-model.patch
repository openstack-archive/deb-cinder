Description: Make workers ORM compatible with SQLAlchemy 1.1.4
 We don't currently support SQLAlchemy 1.1.4, but in preparation of the
 day we do we can start making simple changes that will facilitate the
 transition.
 .
 In SQLAlchemy 1.1 the .autoincrement directive is no longer implicitly
 enabled for a composite primary key column, so the id field in the
 workers ORM class will no longer be set as autoincrement, which means
 that when creating a worker we will not be updating the id field of the
 instance and it will left as None in memory while it is properly set in
 the DB.
 .
 This patch resolves this issue by defining the id field as an auto
 increment field explicitly instead of relying on the implicit definition
 exiting in SQLAlchemy 1.0.
