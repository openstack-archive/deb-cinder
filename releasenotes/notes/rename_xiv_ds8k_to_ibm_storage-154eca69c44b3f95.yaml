features:
  - The xiv_ds8k driver now supports IBM XIV, Spectrum
    Accelerate, FlashSystem A9000, FlashSystem A9000R
    and DS8000 storage systems, and was renamed to IBM
    Storage Driver for OpenStack. The changes include text
    changes, file names, names of cinder.conf flags, and
    names of the proxy classes.
upgrade:
  - Users of the IBM Storage Driver, previously known as
    the IBM XIV/DS8K driver, upgrading from Mitaka or
    previous releases, need to reconfigure the relevant
    cinder.conf entries. In most cases the change is just
    removal of the xiv-ds8k field prefix, but for details
    use the driver documentation.
