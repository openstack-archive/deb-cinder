upgrade:
  - Deployments doing continuous live upgrades from master branch should not
    upgrade into Ocata before doing an upgrade which includes all the Newton's
    RPC API version bump commits (scheduler, volume). If you're upgrading
    deployment in a release-to-release manner, then you can safely ignore this
    note.
