features:
  - Added host-level (whole back end replication - v2.1) replication support
    to the NetApp cDOT drivers (iSCSI, FC, NFS).
upgrade:
  - While configuring NetApp cDOT back ends, new configuration options
    ('replication_device' and 'netapp_replication_aggregate_map') must be
    added in order to use the host-level failover feature.
