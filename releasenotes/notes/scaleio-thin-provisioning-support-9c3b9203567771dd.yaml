features:
  - Added support for oversubscription in thin provisioning in the
    ScaleIO driver.
    Volumes should have extra_specs with the key provisioning:type with value
    equals to either 'thick' or 'thin'.
    max_oversubscription_ratio can be defined by the global config or for
    ScaleIO specific with the config option sio_max_over_subscription_ratio.
    The maximum oversubscription ratio supported at the moment is 10.0.
